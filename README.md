# Time-Series-Analysis

Step-1: Introduction to stats Model using Python{Statsmodels is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for
conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. An extensive list of result statistics are available for each estimator. The results
are tested against existing statistical packages to ensure that they are correct. The package is released under the open source Modified
BSD (3-clause) license. The online documentation is hosted at statsmodels.org.}

Step2: EWMA-The Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) is a statistic for monitoring the process that averages the data in a way that gives less and less weight to data as they are further removed in time.

Step-3: ETS decomposition- ETS stands for Error-Trend-Seasonality and is a model used for the time series decomposition. It decomposes the series into the error, trend and seasonality component. It is a univariate forecasting model used when dealing with time-series data. It focuses on trend and seasonal components.

Step-4:what does ARIMA models will do? The ARIMA model predicts a given time series based on its own past values. It can be used for any nonseasonal series of numbers that exhibits patterns and is not a series of random events.

Step-5:What are the differences between Auto ARIMA and ETS models? Both models are widely used approaches in forecasting time series data. However, the two models differ in the main component that is focused on. ETS models focus on the trend and seasonality in the data while ARIMA focuses on the autocorrelations in the data.
